# Heart Disease Prediction Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of predicting heart disease using machine learning. It uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains various medical features for patients and whether they have heart disease or not.

## Contents

- `heart-disease-prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `heart.csv`: The dataset file used in the notebook.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```shell
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `heart-disease-prediction.ipynb` to reproduce the heart disease prediction analysis.
4. Follow along with the explanations and code in the notebook to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
5. Feel free to modify or experiment with the code and parameters to further enhance the predictions or explore different aspects of the dataset.

## Additional Notes

- The notebook uses a Decision Tree Classifier for heart disease prediction, but you can try other classification algorithms as well.
- Make sure to update the file paths or filenames if you modify the directory structure or dataset name.
